# 1. Game Concept: Dungeon Codex

## 1.1. Core Vision

**Dungeon Codex** is a roguelike game that blends procedural dungeon exploration with a deep crafting system. Players take on the role of an adventurer who delves into dangerous, ever-changing dungeons to gather rare materials. These materials are then used to craft and upgrade equipment, abilities, and even the character itself, creating a satisfying loop of exploration, discovery, and character progression.

## 1.2. Genre and Platform

-   **Primary Genre:** Roguelike / Dungeon Crawler
-   **Secondary Genre:** Crafting, RPG
-   **Target Platforms:**
    -   Mobile (Android first)
    -   Web (HTML5)
-   **Monetization (Future):** Optional cosmetic items, potential for blockchain integration (NFTs) for unique items.

## 1.3. Target Audience

This game is for players who enjoy:

-   The challenge and replayability of roguelikes (e.g., *Slay the Spire*, *Hades*).
-   Deep crafting and progression systems.
-   Strategic, turn-based combat.
-   Games that can be played in short bursts, making it ideal for mobile platforms.

## 1.4. Unique Selling Points (USPs)

-   **Crafting-Centric Progression:** Unlike traditional RPGs where loot is the primary reward, in Dungeon Codex, the focus is on gathering raw materials to craft your own power.

-   **Cross-Platform Experience:** Seamlessly play on your mobile device or in a web browser.
-   **Tactical Turn-Based Combat:** Combat is not just about stats but about positioning, ability usage, and preparing the right gear for the right encounter.
